# art_identifcation_using_CNN
Codes for indentifying arts using convolutional neural networks (CNN).
We used art paintings provided in Kaggle competion https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers/data. 

We provide codes for preprocessing purposes such as, resizing images and relabeling data. 

1. A simple jupyter notebook to preprocess images and generate binary numpy files are  avalaible in `data/convert_images_to_numpy.ipynb`

2. The helper functions can be found in the `tools/`

3. A python code to perform classification with TensorFlow is avalaible in `models/CNN_classifer.ipynb` (to be added soon)


This package is still under development and more features will be added.
