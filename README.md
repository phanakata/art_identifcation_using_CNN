# art_identifcation_using_CNN
Codes for indentifying arts using convolutional neural networks (CNN).
We used art paintings provided in Kaggle competion. 

We provide codes for preprocessing purposes such as, resizing images and relabeling data. 

A simple jupyter notebook to preprocess images and generate binary numpy files are  avalaible in `models/convert_images_to_numpyFile.ipynb`

The helper functions can be found in the `tools/`

A python code to perform classification with TensorFlow is avalaible in `models/CNN_classifer.ipynb`


This package is still under development and more features will be added.
